My bash configurations, under source control. Easy to sync between machines.

*Note:* also contains non-bash configs, such as Xdefaults (urxvt, etc.).

**Install**

Place these contents under one of the following typical locations: 

* `~/.bash`
* `~/.config/bash/`

From .bashrc, &forall;`config files` &isin;`~/.bash`, include 
source declaration `. ~/.bash/filename.sh`. I should probably write an 
installer script to make new installs / deployment easy. 

**My other dotfiles and configs**
